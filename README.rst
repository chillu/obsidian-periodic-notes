Periodic Notes ⌚
*****************

This is a not-really-fork of `github.com/liamcain/obsidian-public-notes <https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes>`__ for personal use.
The upstream project appears abandoned:

- A 1.0.0-beta.3 release was prepared in 2022, but nothing has happened in the 3 years since.
- There is a long list of issues with no response.
- There are no instructions for developers or would-be maintainers or contributors.

As I'm neither a Java-/TypeScript dev nor keen to invest time propping up Obsidian, this ‘fork’ is actually a mirror of the ``main.js`` that is installed as the plugin, rather than the upstream TypeScript sources.
The git history and inline comments like ``NB(PNK)`` serve to identify modifications made.
